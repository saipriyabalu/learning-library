3. Now from the **Source**, select the **location** as Local Database, **type** as SQL Query and insert the following SQL query. Also, in the Column Mapping section, select the **label** as Status and **Value** as C.

      ```
      select "STATUS", count(*) c 
      from "PROJECTS" 
      group by "STATUS" 
      order by 2 desc  
      ```

4. Click on the play button on the top right to view the chart.

**Chart 2 - Project Status**

1. Select the chart 2. This chart would be more meaningful if it also displayed project budgets for comparison. Update the following in the property editor and save the changes:

**Identification** - Project Budgets and Costs
**Type** - Bar
**Identification** - Name - enter Costs
**Source** - SQL Query - click the Code Editor icon (SQL Query).

      ```
      select p.name, sum(cost) value
      from tasks t
      , projects p
      where p.id = t.project_id
      group by p.name
      order by 1
      ```
**Column Mapping** - Label - Name, Value - Value

In Property Editor:
**Identification**: Name - Budgets
**Source**: Table Name - click the LOV icon. Select PROJECTS.
**Column Mapping**: Label - select NAME, Value - select BUDGET

Click Save and Run Page. Review the changes to the labels along the X-axis and the new columns for each project. You can also mouse over each column for more details.

## **Step 3:** Updating the appearence of the dashboard charts

The chart lacks a legend to indicate which column represents which value (cost or budget). The cost and budget values lack a dollar sign. These changes are in the region attributes and axis properties for the chart.

To change the **attributes** of a region:

1. Go to the Page Designer. In the Rendering tab, under Project Budgets and Costs, click **Attributes**.

2. Updated the properties in the **Property Editor**:
**Layout**: Height - enter 600
**Legend**: Show - click to enable, Position - select Top, Hide and Show Behavior- select No Rescaling

3. To change the properties of an axis, in the Rendering tab, under Axes, click y.

4. Updated the properties in the **Property Editor**:

**Value**: Format - select Currency, Currency - enter $

Click **Save and Run Page.**

The runtime reloads, but you must scroll down within the region to see your changes to the chart.
